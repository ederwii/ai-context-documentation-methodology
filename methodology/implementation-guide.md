# AI-Context Documentation V2 Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **AI-Context Documentation V2 Implementation Guide**

This guide provides a step-by-step process for implementing AI-Context Documentation V2 in any software project using cost-controlled, multi-pass approaches. Follow these steps to create comprehensive, AI-assistant-friendly documentation that serves as your project's single source of truth.

## 📋 **Implementation Overview**

### **V2 Enhancements**
- **Project Size Assessment**: Automatic sizing and approach selection
- **Cost Control**: Token budgets and optimization strategies
- **Multi-Pass Workflows**: Scalable approaches for projects of all sizes
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Facts/Assumptions/Decisions format with citations
- **Audit Trails**: Journal system for continuity and maintenance

### **Timeline by Project Size**
- **New Projects**: 1-2 hours (planning-focused)
- **Small Projects**: 2-3 hours (single-pass analysis)
- **Medium Projects**: 4-6 hours (two-pass selective analysis)
- **Large Projects**: 1-2 days (four-pass pipeline)

### **Prerequisites**
- Access to your project codebase
- An AI assistant (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Token budget planning (see cost-control.md)
- Basic understanding of your project architecture

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Project Assessment and Setup**

### **Step 1: Project Size Assessment**

Before starting documentation, assess your project size to choose the optimal approach:

#### **Option A: Use Project Sizer (Recommended)**
1. Copy the [Project Sizer Prompt](../tools/prompts/project-sizer.md)
2. Paste it into your AI assistant conversation
3. Provide basic project information (repository, file count, etc.)
4. Receive size classification and approach recommendation
5. Get tailored budget and workflow suggestions

#### **Option B: Manual Assessment**
Use these criteria to classify your project:
- **New Project**: < 10 files, planning phase
- **Small Project**: < 50 files, < 10K LOC, 1-3 developers
- **Medium Project**: 50-500 files, 10K-100K LOC, 3-10 developers  
- **Large Project**: 500+ files, 100K+ LOC, 10+ developers

### **Step 2: Budget Planning**

Based on your project size, plan your token budget:

```markdown
## Budget Recommendations:

## 📝 **Phase 3: Documentation Execution**

### **Step 1: Execute Your Chosen Workflow**

Based on your project assessment, use the appropriate V2 prompt:

#### **For All Project Sizes:**
1. Copy the [AI-Context Documentation V2 Prompt](../tools/prompts/ai-context-documentation-v2-prompt.md)
2. Paste it into your AI assistant conversation
3. Provide your project configuration and context
4. Follow the size-specific workflow recommendations
5. Monitor token usage and adjust scope as needed

#### **Key V2 Execution Principles:**
- **Always use single quotes** in all shell commands and examples [[memory:5653285]]
- **Cite every claim** with file paths or mark as 'unknown'
- **Use Facts/Assumptions/Decisions format** in all documents
- **Track token usage** and defer items when approaching budget limits
- **Document everything** in the project journal

### **Step 2: Quality Validation**

After documentation generation, validate quality:

#### **Content Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All major components documented with file paths
- [ ] All claims include citations or 'unknown' markers  
- [ ] Facts/Assumptions/Decisions blocks in every document
- [ ] No unsupported claims about implementation
- [ ] All code references include exact file paths

#### **Budget Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Token budget respected throughout process
- [ ] Example policy consistently applied
- [ ] Deferred items clearly marked with TODO
- [ ] Budget utilization documented in journal

#### **Format Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Single quotes used in all shell commands [[memory:5653285]]
- [ ] Consistent markdown formatting
- [ ] Proper cross-references between documents
- [ ] Clear navigation structure in INDEX.md

### **Step 3: Setup Documentation Structure**

Create the `cursor-docs/` folder in your project root:

```bash
mkdir cursor-docs
cd cursor-docs
```

Your final structure should include:

```
cursor-docs/
├── config.yml                  # Project configuration
├── journal.md                  # Audit trail and session log
├── INDEX.md                    # Navigation hub
├── architecture-overview.md    # System design
├── data-models.md             # Interfaces and schemas
├── [additional docs based on project size]
└── [deferred items tracking]
```

## 🔄 **Phase 4: Maintenance and Updates**

### **Step 1: Setup Maintenance Procedures**

#### **Journal Maintenance:**
1. Copy the [Journal Template](../templates/journal-template.md) to `cursor-docs/journal.md`
2. Create initial journal entry documenting the setup process
3. Include session goals, token usage, and decisions made
4. Set up regular journal review schedule

#### **Configuration Maintenance:**
1. Review and update `config.yml` based on actual usage
2. Adjust token budgets based on session results
3. Update priority paths based on development patterns
4. Configure automated update triggers

### **Step 2: Delta Update Strategy**

For ongoing maintenance, use delta updates instead of full regeneration:

#### **Git-Based Delta Detection:**
```bash
# Identify changed files since last documentation update
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD

# Focus updates on changed areas only
git log --since='1 week ago' --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq
```

#### **Smart Update Triggers:**
Configure automatic documentation updates when specific files change:
- `src/models/*.js` → Update `data-models.md`
- `src/routes/*.js` → Update `api-documentation.md`
- `src/components/*.js` → Update `components.md`
- `package.json` → Update `architecture-overview.md`

### **Step 3: Quality Monitoring**

#### **Monthly Documentation Review:**
1. Review journal entries for patterns and improvements
2. Analyze token usage and optimization opportunities
3. Update deferred items and plan next priorities
4. Gather team feedback on documentation effectiveness

#### **Quarterly Process Review:**
1. Assess documentation impact on team productivity
2. Review and update methodology based on lessons learned
3. Plan process improvements and tool integrations
4. Update configuration and templates based on experience

## 💡 **V2 Best Practices**

### **Cost Optimization:**
- Start with project sizing to choose appropriate workflow
- Use link-only examples by default, code blocks on request
