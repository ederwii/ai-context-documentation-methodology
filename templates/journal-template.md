## 🎯 **Sample Entries**

### **Initial Documentation Creation**

## 2024-01-15 14:30 - INITIAL_CREATION
**Goal**: Create comprehensive AI-context documentation for e-commerce web app
**Context**: New team member onboarding taking too long, AI assistants lack project context
**Budget**: 35K tokens | **Used**: 28.5K tokens (81%)
**Duration**: 4.5 hours

### 📊 Facts Discovered
- React 18 frontend with TypeScript located in `src/components/` (verified in package.json)
- Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB using Mongoose ODM (verified in src/server.js)
- JWT authentication implemented in `src/middleware/auth.js:15-45` (verified)
- 23 API endpoints across 5 route files in `src/routes/` (counted)
- Payment integration with Stripe in `src/services/payment.js` (verified)

### 🤔 Assumptions Made
- User sessions expire after 24 hours (inferred from JWT config, not explicitly set)
- Database connection pooling uses default Mongoose settings (not configured explicitly)
- Frontend state management uses Context API (inferred from component patterns)

### ✅ Decisions Made
- Prioritized user-facing components over internal utilities for documentation
- Used link-only examples to stay within budget constraints
- Documented API endpoints based on route definitions rather than OpenAPI spec
- Excluded test files from component documentation to focus on implementation

### 📁 Files Processed
- `package.json` - Technology stack identification
- `src/components/` (47 files) - React component analysis
- `src/routes/` (5 files) - API endpoint documentation
- `src/models/` (8 files) - Data model extraction
- `src/middleware/` (3 files) - Authentication and validation logic
- `src/services/` (6 files) - External service integrations

### 📚 Documents Updated/Created
- **Created**: `cursor-docs/INDEX.md` - Navigation hub with quick reference links
- **Created**: `cursor-docs/architecture-overview.md` - System design and data flow
- **Created**: `cursor-docs/components.md` - React component hierarchy and relationships
- **Created**: `cursor-docs/api-documentation.md` - All 23 endpoints with auth requirements
- **Created**: `cursor-docs/data-models.md` - MongoDB schemas and TypeScript interfaces
- **Created**: `cursor-docs/development-workflow.md` - Setup, testing, and deployment processes

### 🚧 Deferred Items
- Performance optimization documentation - Est. 3K tokens (payment processing bottlenecks need investigation)
- Security implementation details - Est. 2K tokens (requires security audit results)
- Complete error handling patterns - Est. 1.5K tokens (scattered across multiple files)

### 🎯 Next Session Priorities
1. Update known-issues.md when bug reports come in (Est. 500 tokens per issue)
2. Document performance optimization strategies after load testing (Est. 3K tokens)
3. Add security documentation after security review (Est. 2K tokens)

### 💡 Lessons Learned
- Component documentation was more valuable than expected for team onboarding
- Link-only examples worked well - team prefers exploring actual code
- JWT configuration assumptions need verification with backend team
- API documentation format should include request/response examples

### **Delta Update Session**

## 2024-01-22 09:15 - DELTA_UPDATE
**Goal**: Update documentation after payment system refactoring
**Context**: Stripe integration replaced with PayPal, API endpoints changed
**Budget**: 5K tokens | **Used**: 3.2K tokens (64%)
**Duration**: 45 minutes

### 📊 Facts Discovered
- Payment service moved from `src/services/payment.js` to `src/services/paypal.js` (verified)
- 3 new API endpoints added: `/api/payments/paypal/*` (verified in src/routes/payments.js)
- Webhook handling added in `src/controllers/webhooks.js` (new file)
- Environment variables changed: STRIPE_* replaced with PAYPAL_* (verified in .env.example)

### 🤔 Assumptions Made
- PayPal sandbox is used in development (inferred from config patterns)
- Webhook verification follows PayPal standard practices (not implemented yet)

### ✅ Decisions Made
- Updated only payment-related documentation to minimize token usage
- Kept Stripe documentation in known-issues.md as 'deprecated' for reference
- Added webhook documentation to api-documentation.md

### 📁 Files Processed
- `src/services/paypal.js` - New payment service implementation
- `src/routes/payments.js` - Updated payment endpoints
- `src/controllers/webhooks.js` - New webhook handling
- `.env.example` - Updated environment variables

### 📚 Documents Updated/Created
- **Updated**: `cursor-docs/api-documentation.md` - Added 3 PayPal endpoints, marked Stripe endpoints as deprecated
- **Updated**: `cursor-docs/data-models.md` - Added PayPal transaction schema
- **Updated**: `cursor-docs/architecture-overview.md` - Updated payment flow diagram reference
- **Updated**: `cursor-docs/known-issues.md` - Added Stripe deprecation note and PayPal migration status

### 🚧 Deferred Items
- PayPal webhook security implementation documentation - Est. 1K tokens (pending security review)
- Payment error handling patterns - Est. 1.5K tokens (implementation in progress)

### 🎯 Next Session Priorities
1. Document webhook security once implementation is complete (Est. 1K tokens)
2. Update deployment guide with PayPal environment variables (Est. 500 tokens)

### 💡 Lessons Learned
- Delta updates are much more efficient than full regeneration (5x token savings)
- Keeping deprecated information in known-issues.md helps with transition
- Payment system changes have wider documentation impact than expected

- 3 similar issues reported in GitHub issues #45, #52, #61 (verified)

### 🤔 Assumptions Made
- Bug existed since initial implementation (no evidence of recent introduction)
- All affected users will need to re-login once (standard practice for auth fixes)

### ✅ Decisions Made
- Added detailed bug description to known-issues.md
- Updated authentication flow documentation with fix details
- Added testing recommendations to prevent regression

### 📁 Files Processed

2. Consider adding authentication troubleshooting guide if more issues arise

### 💡 Lessons Learned
- Bug documentation is quick and high-value for team knowledge sharing
- Including GitHub issue references helps connect documentation to project history
- Testing recommendations prevent similar issues and improve documentation quality
